# MVP

- [x] Sketch out static markup for parity with spreadsheet
- [ ] In-app instructions/docs
- [ ] Get GitHub Page working
- [x] Basic README
- [ ] Add data/interactivity


# Future - High Impact

* add textarea for adding notes to each account
* export/import JSON to save permenantly
* what else is in spreadsheet that want to replicate?
* link fund symbols to a page on fidelity.com or somewhere with data about them
* add display order for each tag, rather than sorting alphabetically. want to compare domestic vs intl side-by-side
* calculate things automatically rather than making the user do it, ala http://optimalrebalancing.tk 
* setup github action to automatically rebuild GH Pages branch - probably existing one you can use instead of writing from scratch


# Future - Low Impact

* link to some educational info about rebalancing
* post it on Bogleheads etc to promote it?
* show pie charts for allocations, but maybe that's just fluff?
