			<!-- probably a better ux for show/hiding instructions than this-->
			<details>
				<summary>
				This calculator helps you rebalance an investment portfolio using the 'buy and hold' strategy. Instead of selling funds that have drifted above their target asset allocation, you direct your monthly deposits to the under-weighted funds until they reach their target allocation.
				</summary>

				reasons for using that strategy - avoid paying taxes to sell within a taxable account; x, y

				there are 2 methods to rebalance: 1) sell then buy; 2) just buy. this is for the latter. {link to educational info}

				<p>instructions - enter your data, it'll be saved locally so will be here next time you vitis, but won't be leaked outside your computer
					the code is open source so you can verify that, view at github.com/iandunn/buy-and-hold-rebalancing-calculator
